Collective modelling relations is also especially useful for cold-start estimation for entities with no observed data for the relation being predicted.\r\n\r\n* As our model embeds all the entities in the same latent-space, it is able to compute similarity between entities that do not participate in the same relation in the database schema.\r\n\r\n* We use the probabilistic interpretation of matrix factorization and learn model parameters by maximizing the log-likelihood of the observed data.\r\n\r\n* We demonstrate the efficacy of our collective factorization model on relation prediction, cold-start estimation and entity similarity estimation by evaluating on the [Yelp Datasets](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).\r\n\r\n### The report for the project can be found [here](http://nitishgupta.github.io/docs/gupta-factordb.pdf) ###\r\n","google":"UA-58092581-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
